#### **`runst`** â€” A dead simple notification daemon ðŸ””ðŸ’¬

</div>

[Desktop notifications](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_notifications) are small, passive popup dialogs that notify the user of particular events in an asynchronous manner. These passive popups can automatically disappear after a short period of time.

`runst` is the server implementation of [freedesktop.org](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki) - [Desktop Notifications Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/notification-spec-latest.html) and it can be used to receive notifications from applications via [D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/). As of now, only [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) is supported.

## Usage

## Why this exists?

I have been an user of [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) for a long time. However, they made some [uncool breaking changes](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/issues/940) in [v1.7.0](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/releases/tag/v1.7.0) and it completely broke my configuration. That day, I refused to update `dunst` (I was too lazy to re-configure) and decided to write my own notification server using Rust.

I wanted to keep `runst` simple since the way I use `dunst` was really simple. I was only showing an overlay window on top of [i3status](https://github.com/i3/i3status) as shown below:

And that's how `runst` is born.
