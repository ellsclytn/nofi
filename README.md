#### **`runst`** â€” A dead simple notification daemon ðŸ””ðŸ’¬

</div>

[Desktop notifications](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_notifications) are small, passive popup dialogs that notify the user of particular events in an asynchronous manner. These passive popups can automatically disappear after a short period of time.

`runst` is the server implementation of [freedesktop.org](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki) - [Desktop Notifications Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/notification-spec-latest.html) and it can be used to receive notifications from applications via [D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/). As of now, only [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) is supported.

## Features

- Fully customizable notification window (size, location, text, colors).
- Template-powered ([Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)/[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/templates/)) notification text.
- Auto-clear notifications based on a fixed time or estimated read time.
- Run custom OS commands based on the matched notifications.

## Installation

## Usage

## Why this exists?

I have been an user of [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) for a long time. However, in my opinion, they made some [uncool breaking changes](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/issues/940) in [v1.7.0](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/releases/tag/v1.7.0).
